# Modern React with Redux
## An Intro to React

### Environment Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git

$ npm install // Installs dependencies for project

$ npm start // Starts boilerplate package and runs a local server
```

### Project Setup

*How is this working?*
  * First, we write some JavaScript inside of the package
  * **Babel** and **Webpack** bundle all those files together, compiles everything to ES5, and runs a local server
    * `localhost:8080`
